# icanseebootstrap

:sparkles: A simple bootstrap mock up page. :sparkles:

## Functionality  🔨 

Some funcitonality has been added:
The 'show more' option at the bottom the notification tile, 
does indeed show more notifications. 

For the reminder section, the cards can be hidden, but other than removing the pre-set cards, the remindersection does not have any funationality. 

There is only two modals active as requested, the 5 year anversary milstone modal and the charity football tournament modal. 

The accordian in the notifications section works as expected. 

I added some animations to the milestones - I think they are a bit overwhelming for the page design, but I kep them anyway, just to add micro interactions. I think it fitting to <b>this</b> project, but wouldn't neccesary use for a production project.
